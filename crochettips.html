<h1>Crochet Tips To Remember</h1>

<div class="tip-section">
  <h2>Choosing the Right Hook</h2>
  <p>Start with a 5mm or 6mm hook for easier stitches and faster progress. You can find the size of hooks right on the handles! Hooks can be bought in a variety pack with different sizes, especially at craft stores or online. </p>
</div>

<div class="tip-section">
  <h2>Yarn Weight</h2>
  <p>Medium weight yarn is perfect for most projects. Thin types of yarn can increase stress and lower patience because it will add time to your crochet projects. Chunky yarn can be used for quick projects, but it may be harder to adjust the size and shapes.</p>
</div>

<div class="tip-section">
  <h2>Understanding Gauge</h2>
  <p>"Gauge" determines how your crochet items will fit or the size it will be when completed. It also refers to how tight or loose your stitches are. You can use a ruler, or count the number of stitches you have in each row, to determine your gauge.</p>
</div>

<div class="tip-section">
  <h2>Mastering Tension</h2>
  <p>Too much tension or "tightness" in your yarn can make your stitches difficult to work with and take apart in case of accidents. To ease tension, you can relax your wrist and keep yarn flowing smoothly between your fingers. Staying aware of your tension can also help with practicing keeping stitches consistent.</p>

<div class="tip-section">
  <h2>Avoiding Common Mistakes</h2>
  <p>Have you ever needed to take apart one of your projects? This is a common experience for beginners and even experienced crocheters. Common mistakes includes adding an extra stitch somewhere in your project, especially when working with squares or rectangular pieces. Using stitch markers can help mitigate using too many stitches. Another common mistake is not securely weaving in the ends of your yarn after a completed project. Especially after washing, this can cause projects to come apart.</p>
</div>

<div class="tip-section">
  <h2>Blocking & Finishing</h2>
  <p>You can steam or wet flat or rectangular projects to help them lay flat after drying. Other crocheters use fire to carefully singe loose ends. This allows for a clean, professional look to your piece because the ends are sealed and flyaways are gently burned away. Before using fire for any project, make sure to research the type of yarn you're using to avoid any accidents and damage</p>
