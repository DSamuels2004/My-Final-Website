      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        Hello, hello! My name is Dallasia Samuels, and I am journalism student at the University of Nevada, Reno practiting my web development skills. I discovered crochet when I was 16 years old. I even sold a few crochet tops online through Instagram after I started to post my work. However, since working and going to school, I have slowed down on my hobby. I am excited to share my knowledge of crochet with you all!

       Before working, I used crochet as a way to make some pocket money. I would create swimsuits and sweaters to sell them for about $30-$50. The most I made on a top was $150. I would always create an original design using a sketch book before selling my pieces. It didn't feel right to copy someone's design and make money off of it. However, it wasnt easy to come up with original designs all the time. I would often get stuck on what to make next. With time, practice, and watching Youtube videos, I was able to create more unique pieces by understanding simple stitches. I don't crochet as much today but I'm hoping to get back into it soon! I hope you enjoy.
