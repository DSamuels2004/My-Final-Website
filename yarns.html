<h1>Different Types of Yarn</h1>

<div class="yarn-container">
  <div class="yarn-box">
    <h3>Cotton</h3>
    <p1>Soft, breathable, great for summer projects like tops and swimwear.</p1>
    <p> Cotton yarn is more expensive than acrylic yarn. That's because it's more durable and doesn't snag or stretch as you're working with a crochet hook. Cotton may shrink after washing, but with the right temperature and wash cycle, crochet items created with cotton yarn will last a while.</p>

    <h3>Wool</h3>
    <p1>Fuzzy and warm, perfect for sweaters, gloves, and winter accessories.</p1>
    <p>Wool yarn can be synthetically or authentically created to mimic animal-like textures and hair. For example, alpaca yarn is the most common form of wool yarn. It feels similar to cotton yarn due to its softness, but wool yarn will give that extra fuzzy feeling that no other yarn can deliver. </p>

    <h3>Acrylic</h3>
    <p1>More affordable, durable, and easy to care for, ideal for everyday items.</p1>
    <p>Acrylic yarn is made from a synthetic fiber that can mimic the look and feel of cotton yarn. It is the most commonly used type of fabric for crocheters and knitters. Acrylic yarn is also available in a wide range of colors and textures, making it a versatile option for many different types of projects.</p>

    <h3>Chunky</h3>
    <p1>Easy to work with, warm, thick, perfect for blankets or coats.</p1>
    <p>Chunky yarn is a thicker type of yarn that is perfect for creating warm and cozy items! It is also great for beginners because the larger stitches are easier to see and work through with a crochet hook. Chunky yarn can come in a variety of materials including wool, acrylic, and cotton.</p>
